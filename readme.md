# Template Project

The premis of this project is to give myself a good staring base for working on a project using Angular, Express and others.  The goal is to have a basic page that has a basic webpage displayed, server, and routing working.  It should be 'running' to the most basic degree to build off, but to have deployed on Heroku or other sites for proof of concept.


The project readme will be updated with current information but possible technologies that my get included.
- Gulp
- SASS
- MongoDB
- ???

# Why I'm making this Template

Although there are many template you can find online my primary focus is not to just have a temple I or others could use.  But more to walk through the process step by step with explinations so anyone can build this on their own and have a better understanding of whats happening and why.

Most people will never build a project from scratch like this however that is all the more reason I would like there to be another resource for people to look at and understand whats going on.

You will need to already have Node and NPM installed on your machine. However we will run through the rest.
